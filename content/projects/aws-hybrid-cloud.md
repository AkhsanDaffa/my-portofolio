### Project Overview
Built event-driven image processing system using AWS EC2, S3, SQS, and Raspberry Pi. 

### Architecture & Tech Stack
* **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS EC2, S3, SQS
* **IaC:** Automated AWS infrastructure provisioning with **Terraform**.
* **Containerization:** Deployed containerized applications via **Docker Compose**.
* **Edge Computing:** Integrated with **Raspberry Pi** for hybrid cloud processing.

### Key Outcomes
Enabled scalable hybrid cloud processing, bridging the gap between local edge devices (Raspberry Pi) and scalable cloud environments (AWS).

### Project Overview
Migrated legacy Go-based IoT architecture to an Edge Kubernetes (K3s) cluster on Raspberry Pi using Helm.

### Architecture & Tech Stack
* **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K3s) cluster on Raspberry Pi
* **Package Manager:** Helm Charts for deployment
* **CI/CD:** Multi-arch CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
* **Observability:** Prometheus & Grafana for enterprise monitoring
* **Edge Computing:** Raspberry Pi 4B as edge nodes

### Key Outcomes
* Successful migration of legacy IoT architecture to Kubernetes
* Implemented multi-architecture CI/CD (ARM64/AMD64)
* Enterprise-grade observability with real-time monitoring dashboards

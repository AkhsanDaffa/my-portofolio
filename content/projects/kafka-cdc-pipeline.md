* **CDC:** Debezium for database change capture
* **Data Warehouse:** StarRocks for real-time analytics
* **Monitoring:** Prometheus & Grafana for pipeline health

### Key Outcomes
* Enabled real-time data synchronization with < 1 second latency
* Processed millions of events daily without data loss
* Reduced data pipeline maintenance by 70%

### Project Overview
Engineered high-performance Jenkins CI/CD pipeline with Docker Compose orchestration on Ubuntu Server.

### Architecture & Tech Stack
* **CI/CD Server:** Jenkins with Docker-in-Docker (DinD)
* **Orchestration:** Docker Compose for local development
* **Automation:** GitHub Actions for repository management
* **Security:** Automated vulnerability scanning (Trivy)
* **Platform:** Ubuntu Server, ARM64 (Raspberry Pi)

### Key Outcomes
* Reduced deployment time from 30 minutes to 5 minutes
* Implemented automated security scanning - caught 15+ vulnerabilities pre-production
* Achieved 99.9% pipeline success rate
* Optimized hardware resources for ARM64 edge computing
* Zero-downtime deployments using blue-green strategy
